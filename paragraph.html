    <p>It's an extraordinary effort to contain the fallout of the collapsed financial institution from spreading to
        other parts of the US banking sector. Treasury officials say all the bank's customers will be able to get all
        their funds at no cost to taxpayers. And HSBC said it is purchasing the U.K. subsidiary of the bank for just 1
        pound.
        FADEL: Wow. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn joins us now to discuss all that's happening. Hi, Bobby.
        BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.
        FADEL: So what exactly is the federal government doing to avert a crisis here?
        ALLYN: So federal regulators are making sure that customers who have collectively billions of dollars in the
        bank - that they will be able to get their money, right? So many of these customers are tech startups that said
        they'd have to cease operations and wouldn't be able to pay their employees unless they could access their
        funds. Now, federal insurance typically covers up to $250,000 when a bank fails. But more than 90% of Silicon
        Valley Bank accounts were above that amount. So Treasury officials took the pretty extraordinary step here,
        Leila, of waiving that insurance cap.
        FADEL: OK, Bobby. So no taxpayer money. Where does this money come from?
        ALLYN: So the money's coming from this insurance fund that banks pay into. And because this bank is being bailed
        out, it means the fund is going to be pretty depleted.
        FADEL: OK. So Biden administration officials seem intent on saying this is not a bailout. But is it a bailout?
        ALLYN: Right. I mean, in the traditional sense, no, this isn't the 2008 financial crisis bailout that relied on
        hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money. That's not the case here. Banks are not being rescued here.
        In another sense, though, it is the government taking emergency actions to save the bank's depositors. And it's
        quite notable that the government's intervention is a huge lifeline for the tech industry - right? - an industry
        that historically has been pretty hostile to government regulation and oversight.
        FADEL: So tell me more about that. What did the bank do with all the new money it had?
        ALLYN: Well, the bank took a big chunk of this new money and invested it in long-term government securities. And
        this is where the trouble really started. High interest rates have meant those investments in government
        securities were not paying off. And at the same time, tech startups were running out of cash and having a really
        hard time fundraising. So they kept going back to the bank and pulling more and more money out. That created a
        crisis. So the bank said, oh, God, what are we going to do? They decided to sell off a massive amount of these
        government securities to make sure they just had enough money in the bank, which triggered all sorts of panic.
        And customers pulled out $42 billion on Thursday alone. And soon after, the bank went under.
        It's an extraordinary effort to contain the fallout of the collapsed financial institution from spreading to
        other parts of the US banking sector. Treasury officials say all the bank's customers will be able to get all
        their funds at no cost to taxpayers. And HSBC said it is purchasing the U.K. subsidiary of the bank for just 1
